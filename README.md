# Travel Assistant Agent üåç‚úàÔ∏è

This project provides an **AI-powered Travel Assistant** that helps users plan personalized trips based on their preferences. It leverages **Ollama** for language understanding, **Chroma** for vector search, and **Google Translate** for language translation. Users can input their preferences via text or voice (in multiple languages), upload PDF documents containing travel-related information, and get a fully personalized travel itinerary, including flights, accommodations, activities, and dining options.
